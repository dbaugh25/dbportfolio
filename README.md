# Dahntay Baugh | Personal Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio website, customized and built using the [Dev Portfolio Template by Ryan Fitzgerald](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio).

I’ve tailored the layout, color scheme, dark mode styling, section content, and user interactions to showcase my professional experience, education, skills, and projects. This site is used for job applications and networking purposes.

## Features

- Responsive single-page layout
- Custom dark mode with theme toggle
- Cornell-themed styling
- Headshot and downloadable resume section
- Experience, projects, education, and skills sections
- Built-in smooth scroll navigation and animations
